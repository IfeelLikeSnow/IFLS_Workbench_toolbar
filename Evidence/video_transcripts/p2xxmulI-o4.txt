(04:34) So, we got another candidate for the cheap awful pedal award from the cheap awesome pedal forum on Facebook. And this is the Ginian ring modu proposed by uh some of our colleagues on that forum. Uh 20 bucks, no name brand. I think this is maybe supposed to be a clone of something better. Tell me if you know.
(05:00) This came in an unmarked cardboard box with no instruction manual straight from the People's Republic. And uh I don't know anything about ring mods or anything. And everybody said it was the worst. I was looking for really cheap pedals that would be awful and an interesting way. And uh people said this thing sounds terrible and uh 20 bucks.
(05:21) Give it a try. And I'm I am satisfied. I mean, this is really this um I don't know what the controls do. I don't really know what a ring mod is. Uh it's got sunk. Okay. And that seems to be your distortion. And then frequency is obvious. And uh the ring is like the effect. And then the gain and level.
(05:45) Okay, you can figure that out. But the sunk control seems to give you a pleasingly awful distortion sound. So, it's worth it just for that. [Music] Heat. Heat. And the ring knob seems to enshify
(06:53) everything in a pleasingly horrible manner. And it seems to be something like a pitch shifter that doesn't work very well combined with a bit crusher. And I'm pretty sure that's not what a ring mod is supposed to do in real life. This is just extra shitty from no-name knockoff in the PRC. I'm guessing.
(07:14) Does anybody know about this? Uh I am in no mind to do any research of my own, but if you please leave a comment about what a ring modulator actually is and uh what this is. If you know about Guinea, I'm pretty sure this is just one of those things that they put a name on something that's made in a huge factory that's the size of a mega city made by um people who would probably rather not be working there. Just guessing.
(07:44) So, let's turn off the sunk. See what kind of clean sound we get with the ring by itself. And gradually roll up the frequency. [Music] How do you do? [Music] [Music] [Music]
(09:04) So this sounds more like a Gamalon mod to me and I'm really grateful for that because um I've never gotten anything remotely like an Indonesian gamlon sound and I really like that kind of music and I was always wondering how did they do it for guitar. Sonic youth did stuff like that. Uh putting drumsticks under the strings and picking behind stuff like that.
(09:31) I don't know. Uh, that prepared guitar stuff is above my pay grade, but [Music] Hey, breathe. [Music] Where's [Music] [Music] heat? Heat. Heat. [Music]
(10:46) [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] So, the Ginian ring mod, good for Gamlon, good for loopbased zero and Max
(11:51) Weather's Field. Surprisingly usable to me. I'm going to use it. I mean, they said it was the worst. I have a feeling this is not what a real ring mod is supposed to do. I always heard about ring mods being more like in the context of something like an envelope filter, but an envelope filter is generally like an auto, right? All my life I heard about ring modulators and I heard about ghosts and I heard that ghosts aren't real.
(12:20) And then I heard that ghosts can speak to you as long as you provide them with an infinite supply of white noise. [Music] Wow. Wow. [Music] [Music] So, thanks to the beauty of bargain basement effects pedals providing ghosts
(13:24) with white noise to speak to me too, I am now a firm believer in the occult afterlife. knife spirit world and all that So, that's one good thing you can get for 20 bucks from these things. And uh yeah, I'm going to use this on a lot of songs for Johnny Zent loop based zero if we finally collaborate.
(13:49) Max Weathersfield definitely that goes without saying. So, uh, there will be white noise and, uh, there will be an allround carefree package. Oh, and to the guys at Awesome Cheap Effects Pedals who recommended me this, thank you very much. This is a real winner. Uh, winner for September, a winner for August was the Behringer FX600 gives you hundreds of tones.
(14:18) All Bad for which I wrote the song All Bad Song in quotation marks. So, if you can think of a pedal that's really cheap and awful so that I can attract ghosts and howling wolves and stuff, please write a recommendation in the comments, especially if it's cheap or if it's expensive, but the price has come down so far because it's really, really awful.
(14:41) I keep hearing things about Oral Dream. A U R A L 150 bucks to make horrible obo sounds. Sounds like a dream to me if you can get one for 20 or 30. So, if you made it this far, thanks for watching and here's your all round carefree outro. Heat. Heat. [Music]
