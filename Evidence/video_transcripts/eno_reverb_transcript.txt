(00:00) what is up shredders today i'm here to talk to you about the eno reverb pedal down here and this pedal is not that great it's very cheap and it comes off as very cheap it's a digital reverb in an analog box here and that's exactly what you're getting normally i don't really mind digital effects as long as they sound good and perform well but this thing really doesn't do either one of those things it's very very janky sounding there are a lot of volume spikes when you move the knobs back and forth and it's not that fun to dial
(00:39) in a tone when the volume is spiking up and down and it's so hard to get a nice consistent sound with this thing it has three modes to it and to be honest all the modes sound very similar to each other there's almost no reason to have three different modes to it has as room it has spring and it has well for some reason i've never heard of well in a reverb pedal before it's usually haul but on this it's well and they just sound the same it's it's so hard to explain i kind of feel bad for buying this pedal it's it's a it's a mess three knobs on it are
(01:28) level dry wet and time and to be honest the level and the dry and wet signal are the biggest components of the spikes if the volume is at noon you're going to get less of your output out of your amp in general whether it's through the whether you're playing it through the front of your amp or through the effects loop it's really just sucking the crap out of your tone when your level is at noon so i dimed the level here so i could get the absolute most level i could without losing any of that quality tone i had before
(02:09) whether you're on noon or dimed it just sounds awful and the wet and dry signal it sounds somewhat good at noon but when you move it more towards the wet side of things that's when your whole tone becomes more digital sounding and it just really loses a lot of that organic sound out of your whole your whole tone and so if you want to try to compromise and put it to noon or even less than that you're only going to get a hint of that reverb sound to it so it's it's a lose-lose situation on both ends and lastly we have time which more or
(02:50) less equates your delay time in your reverb so that you can get that reverb type of sound it doesn't sound like it really affects anything too much you get slightly a bit larger reverb when it's dimed but at noon it's still like not really there overall i would say this pedal is very disappointing and just to avoid it at all cost i would love to just tell you that it was good and to be honest i kind of feel a buyer's remorse for buying this pedal even though it was extremely cheap on ebay i really wanted to like this pedal but
(03:30) it's just not good i'm so irritated with it i'm just i wanted this to be good uh but it's it's not so avoid the eno reverb pedal at all cost i hate to be this harsh on it but it is not up to snuff when it comes to just being a quality product so yeah avoid eno reverb at all costs i might try the other eno pedals out we'll see if those are any good but for now yeah this is terrible uh don't buy it besides all of that let's hear the train wreck that is the eno reverb pedal okay this is the clean channel and nothing on it
