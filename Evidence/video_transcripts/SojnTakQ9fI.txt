(00:00) [Music] 2023 was the year for MAV and seems that 2024 will be again what did they do this time stick with [Music] me what's up fellow budget tone Chasers welcome back here to the channel for one more M release after the success of the mini Universe mtiv verb it seems that M decided to bring a pair for it the MV Elemental delay in the same Vibe of the mini Universe the elemental drinks a lot of its inspiration this Trion timeline which was beautifully honored on the original typography of the elemental talking about visual it is the most
(00:45) beautiful pedal from mval minimalist elegant and really well finish it but it's not only the visuals which improve it the small flaws that bother me a lot on the Min Universe this time we're eliminated at all which means much more precise and 30 knobs soft foot switch which allows the pedal to have tap Tempo and hold functions no mistakes on the typing this time and much more visible table of parameters in the back MAV took special care to make a beautiful box featuring this time even a c code which leads to the English manual which is
(01:18) really helpful to understand what to expect from the controls of those nine new algorithms the pedal still allows the power feed via USBC by plugging a 5 volts 1 a supply or the traditional 300 Mah 9vt Center negative power supply in terms of controls and functions the elemental brings nine modulated delay algorithms analog Duo duck tremolo reverse dape ice lowf and finally pattern for the adjustments we'll find four fixed function Ops time which controls Tempo feedback which controls the amount of repetition mix between dry
(01:59) and wet signal and mod which controls the main parameter of modulation the delay in addition the parameter knob controls another specific parameter for each type of algorithm on analog the mod controls the frequency of phase shift and the parameter knob controls the depth of the phase shift effect on Duo the mod controls the speed of the coral effect and the parameter knob controls time difference between the repetitions inside the chus on Duck the mod controls the speed of the cors effect while parameter controls the unpacked speed
(02:35) which is a kind of a swell speed for the tremolo the mod will control the speed of the tremolo while the parameter controls the time speed of the fibrillation delay effect for reverse the mod controls the frequency of the modulation while parameter controls the phase shift for the det the mod controls the speed in which the irregularities appear in the sound while the parameter controls the amount of grid on the sound damage for the ice the mod controls the speed of cutting off the modulation while the parameter controls the pitch of the
(03:07) octave which creates the sound artifacts for the LOI the mod controls the speed of the corus effect pulse while the parameter controls the GD of the effect finally on the pattern the mod controls the speed of the delay effect while the parameter controls the different patterns and pattern speed sounds interesting yeah but the functionalities do not stop there the elemental also offers functions of tap Tempo and hold to freeze the T off the delay for the infinity time what is the most interesting on it is to get the pedal to
(03:39) tap Tempo you don't need to do anything you can simply tap and it automatically moves to tap Tempo mode in the same way if you click the foot switch and hold it moves automatically to hold if you simply click on the foot switch later it will cut the effect without leaving trails so if you want to move back from hold to the regular operation mode you need to keep the foot switch pressed for 3 seconds releasing the hold to the normal function mode when the hold function is on the blue Leed shines lighter and the all the sounds which you
(04:09) play in the meantime are not affected by the delay now let's hear some sound samples of the elemental [Music] [Music]
(05:40) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] n
(07:09) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] la
(08:22) [Applause] [Music] he [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
(09:27) [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
(10:58) [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now that you know how it's sounds I would like to share with you my perception about the elemental the Elemento is crazy good on its algorithms and I am really glad that MV is moving further with functionalities like the tap Tempo and hold but still there are two functions which would make this pedal optimal that they're not there yet the first is the tros mode as the elemental is a true bypass pedal there's no way that you would disengage the
(11:52) pedal effect and keep the last traces of the delay on the background the second is the usage of presets as as the elemental is full of settings and Carries nine different algorithms with a really different functions for its controls without access to presets it becomes almost impossible to use more than one mode without bending your knees and tweaking arms between songs that you're G which is not that comfortable and reliable anyway can we complain about it for sure no for a pedal which nowadays is costing $40 it is impossible
(12:24) to expect those functionalities and honestly speaking I would expect much less than what the mental delivers like the tap Tempo and even the hold functions I would be glad to pay those €40 for a simple onoff pedal with those algorithms but this is only my opinion and now I want to know yours do you like how it sounds let me know here on the comment section below and before closing today's video I would like to invite you also to become a member of the channel and enjoy the additional benefits like early releases of the videos full DIY
