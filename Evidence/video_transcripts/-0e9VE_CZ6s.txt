(00:00) [Music] the silent release of MV is actually making strong rumble on the guitar Community can a $30 pedal beat of 5001 let's take a [Music] look the MV Min universe is one of the three silent releases from MAV in 2023 together with the tank G the evolution of the MAV Cube baby they have once again created a great buz on the budget Guitar Rig community and Always by the same reason how can they achieve so impressive quality in such low cost for sure if we consider the price range of which the mini universe is placed it is
(00:43) not that difficult to beat the cost benefit ratio expectation but I can honestly anticipate that this pedal has much higher PR than you would expect but of course carrying huge conss that we simply cannot understand why let's talk a little bit about the pedal itself the Min universe is a digital mod Reverb machine that carries in it nine different algorithms room Hall blate spring Shimmer Cloud Bloom swell and Loi by the names you can imagine which type of universe the pedal was trying to emulate we need to admit that it's a
(01:21) pretty competent piece of gear in terms of sound algorithm the pedal has also a really competent control interface displaying three Superior knobs for the basic functions depth mix and the Reverb type selection and also three inferior knobs that are the specific parameters for each type of Reverb chosen on the back of the pedal you'll find the least of the parameters according to each type of Reverb honestly this a pretty stupid place to have it because this is where the majority of the people place their Loops to attach the pedal on the boards
(01:52) and even though no one would like to be turning the pedal upside down to check the table parameters there's also a mini USB plug on top on which the producer claims to be useful for future firmware updates and also it can be used as a basic audio interface unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to try it in terms of build quality it's a robust metal casing pretty small one compared to other multiv verb pedals and in my opinion the only visually attractive pedal on the Triad of releases of 2023 from mval unfortunately it's not only a Bed
(02:26) of Roses there are simple design mistakes that make the pedal become from Simply annoying if you're a basic user to impossible to handle it if you're a professional player let's start with the most basic faints there are simple misspelling mistakes on the knobs description like Blom missing an O and swell missing an L worse than that it's the quality of the knobs and switches the plastic knobs make the pedal super fragile and the Reverb selection knob has a big selection uncertainty in a way that sometimes you can have more than one
(03:00) function functions SK it and sometimes no functions SK it even when you rotate the knob the foot switch is Extreme opposite to a soft one it feels and sounds like you're breaking a rock when you step on it but you know what makes the sound of the foot switch look silent the sound it makes when you turn it on when you step on it it's simply this is the Dual breaker of the pedal if you need to engage it when plain it makes it simply impossible to use it of course there are some workarounds like placing it inside the
(03:35) loop of a controller or simply muting the signal chain before engaging the pedal wow sounds like this is the worst pedal you could buy correct but wait a second before coming to conclusions let's take a look at some sound samples made with [Music] it [Music] [Music] [Music]
(05:36) [Music] now let's take a look on how some parameters influence on the pedal [Music] [Music] [Music] sound [Music] [Music]
(06:57) [Music] [Music] [Music] how much would you pay for this sound I guess much more than it costs currently the mini universe is costing around $25 fair enough price to pair it with a mosque Loop box and solve the problem of the food switch engagement amazing solution yeah in a general way the Min universe is for sure the best modulated Reverb from the budget Market repeating the
(08:00) same phenomena as the CBE baby the quality of the mini universe is able to call the attention of even the professional players for sure there are huge flaws of design but those flaws are Justified inside this price range it's important also to highlight that those issues were identified on this specific pedal I have bought and from what I have also researched all the items on the first patch seem to have the same issues it doesn't mean that the MAV cannot correct those issues for the next batches the verb tone are simply
(08:30) gorgeous and have the longest trails you'll find on a pedal from this price range it's perfect for those who play ambient guitars worship or more modern sounds for sure if you're looking for a basic Reverb this is not a pedal for you even the hall room spring and blate functions are highly modulated which can be a little bit overwhelming for those who expect a short Ambience that's all for today my tone Chaser friends I hope you enjoyed this pedal review and if it was helpful to you please consider to hit the like
