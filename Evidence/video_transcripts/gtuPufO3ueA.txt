(00:01) hi everyone today we're looking at the Goku audio dripping delay it's a very beautifully designed analog delay pedal it's going to look great on your pedal board straight up 3 knob design for level repeat and delay so let's plug it in and check it out alright so let's take a look at the Goku and dripping analog delay so difference between digital and analog and a bunch of the other types of delays so this delayed tone is going to have more of a drive a sort of tone to it more like the classic delays like the 60s and 70s if
(00:41) you will not the tape delay but more of an analog delay so it's driven with sort of like a preamp sound to it but you'll understand that as we do it as we as we play it here so a little bit about the signal path we're going through the Goku vintage Drive preamp so it's like a classic American style amplifier preamp sound and then going into a direct box with a speaker simulator going right into the quad capture and then into the laptop if I have time I'm going to do some work with the sonic fuel just to give it a
(01:15) bit of Drive and then that should be about it so clean tone all right and then with everything set at 12 o'clock we're going to turn the goku on the tripping delay [Music] very nice so I think about seven delays there so when we're talking about delays or repeats that's basically what I'm
(02:20) counting here is the amount of repeats that are on that repeat knob so when you get to about 12 o'clock we're talking about the repeats and with the delay that's how quickly those repeats are gonna happen so if I didn't like how I didn't like how slow it was and I wanted to just tighten that up a little bit there can bring the RIP loop sorry and bring the repeats down a little bit there yeah I could just keep going crazy so now they're happening happening so quickly in between it's almost sounding like like a reverb tone they're just
(03:04) even shorter distance between the repeats yep so now you're honest it's almost sounding like a like a reverb okay so let's bring that back up the other way so back up at 12 o'clock [Music] all right so let's go up to 9 o'clock there with the actual delay [Music]
(05:01) okay so let's keep going now so we're gonna take that delay all the way to almost six o'clock [Music] [Music] alright so let's move that back up to 12 and let's give you us now so let's take the repeats down to 6 o'clock so went from about 7 repeats down to 5 just keep
(06:14) going here so the 4 and if we go all the way down you get 1 ok well I guess that's a good idea so you know exactly how many you're dealing with there so you get exactly so you could get deadly accurate number of beats there that's kind of nice and it fades the mouth so it's not like exact volume all the way it kind of trails out a little bit so it fades very nicely cool okay so that's it let's go the other way now so back at 12 then we'll move it up to you o'clock [Music]
(07:33) so now we're getting a little more ambient here if them if that makes sense here so we can we can create some nice sort of I know atmospheric sound they're just [Music] so you could really create nice atmospheric landscape if you will they're nice big full rich sound there [Music] so that's a lot of repeats so if I go all the way up alright so that's the
(08:44) thing to keep in mind and that's not specific to the the dripping that's every delay if you put it with the repeats on Macs you're going to get max repeats and in a lot of cases so much so that the repeats are repeating and repeating and repeating and you get a bit of what's called a feedback loop so it would just get bigger and bigger and bigger so I strongly advise that you don't put your delay on maximum repeats unless you have some really crazy reason to do it you can turn it off very quickly so okay so everything is at 12
(09:16) again so I'm just going to put the sonic fuel overdrive on and we'll hear what it sounds like with some Drive to it I'm thinking a little bit here let's bring the input signal down [Music] [Applause] very nice all right so that is the
(10:31) dripping delay by sonic fuel so let's do a or Sun that was dripping delay by Goku audio so let's do a quick wrap-up and we'll be back right soon we'll be back very soon okay bye alright so what did we think of the dripping delay again with every pedal that I've done so far for Goku Audio Calm it's been straight up 12 o'clock you get something very very usable the analog tone is very nice it's got a very nice vintage tone to it and the repeats are very well defined you can get exactly one if you want and you can go to an infinite number of repeats
(11:17) as well the delay setting the distance between the delay setting was great and so you're not going to have any trouble again once again finding something usable with the Goku pedals I got to say I've been really impressed with this line as of today so go check it out you can find more information at Goku audio calm and don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe alright have an awesome day bye
