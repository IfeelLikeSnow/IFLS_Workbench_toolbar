(00:00) 60 second home features a mix of products that were purchased or provided and content that is a mix of sponsored paid and paid in patreon funded use your eyes ears and common sense to come to your own conclusions hey everyone i'm ryan you're watching 60 cycle hum and in this exciting episode of the affordable series of videos i have a box of dolomo pedals here someone told me they had a bunch more pedals and so i hit up my contact i was like hey i've heard you got more stuff can i check it out so they sent me a
(00:36) stack of them eight petals and all there's one missing one that they didn't have in stock i think the rat style pedal so unfortunately i won't be able to cover that let's see what we got a professional di i don't know how much use i'm going to get out of that i guess it could be nice to have my own di when i show up at church instead of relying on them supplying that all the time a two knob compressor oh here's a fun color bright orange a fuzz ooh i love the color on that fuzz too a three knob fuzz that's bright orange
(01:24) i hope i like it i like that color a lot i don't think the camera's gonna be able to pick up just how neon this is a clear boost what is a clear boost it's got level and if that's a 250 i'm gonna be stoked this is interesting a distortion with two gains on it now we already know from my previous coverage of these pedals that they're re-branded k-line circuits so if you want to do some investigation you can probably figure out which is which based on the controls here a tremolo simple two knob thing super chorus
(02:13) a blue super course another two knobber a lot of two knob pedals in this line a mixing boost level and gain get rid of these boxes [Laughter] oh how should i tackle this i'm not going to be able to demonstrate the di so i'm going to put that to the side uh let's make a little group of petals here let's start with the dirty boys first the fuzz and the distortion [Music] in affordable tradition i'm gonna use an affordable guitar this time the squier starcaster one of my favorite squires of all time there's just something special about
(03:12) this guitar that i bond with recently i've adjusted the pull pieces on the pickups people were suggesting i do that to get a little bit more high-end clarity out of this guitar and i wish i'd done it sooner it honestly did it got me a little bit more brightness out of the pickups [Music] all right let's check these things out fuzz first of course let's start with everything on noon just can't get over the color of this fuzz [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
(04:23) yeah that's a muff that is a muff for sure [Applause] [Music] honestly i think that sounds pretty good you can't beat that color either i really hope the camera picks that up it is just the most ridiculous version of like neon orange that you can imagine right next up this distortion i'm not totally sure what to expect out of this is gray it's got two gain controls you tell me down in the comments what you think it is [Music] [Applause] so [Music]
(05:26) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] so [Music] uh that's interesting i'm not totally sure what to make out of the two gain controls i vaguely remember there being a k-line pedal i covered recently that had two gain controls like that one of those double-sided ones it's kind of like barky woody like high mid focus sounding it's not this like mid scoop sounding drive it could
(06:30) be exactly what you need or you might not need it at all yeah i'm not sure about that one you guys tell me what do you think of the dulmo distortion here i like that fuzz a lot as far as affordable big musco i think that's a winner i'm gonna have to do a big muff shootout soon all the uh affordable big muffs but just on the looks alone i'm kind of smitten with this one let's check out the boosts now maybe we should include the compressor in this all right let's start off with the compressor we'll have the knobs up at double noon see what this sounds
(07:29) like that's a stiff compressor [Music] all the affordable compressors tend to lean into this hard hard compressed like dynacomp kind of sound that's not typically where i like to live with compressed [Music] [Applause] i like compressors that have a clean blend that just kind of do a little bit of compression just fill out the signal a little bit
(08:32) bring up some of the lower frequencies and kind of like are barely there but this is a compressor that is definitely not barely there [Music] even with the comp all the way down it's pretty stiff [Music] it seems to work though if you want like a dynacomp style compressor there it is uh the clear boost now no idea what to expect out of this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
(09:36) [Music] i kind of like that torn speaker kind of broken sort of sound there [Music] i swapped that up a little bit but oh well i kind of like that there's been a couple boosts that are they're dirty in the affordable range and i like them every single time [Music] i mean it does a clean boost just fine [Music] you don't have to make it dirty
(10:41) [Music] but if you aren't making it dirty what's the fun in that right yeah i like that little bit of sparkle it's putting on the edge with a gain right about there [Music] yeah i like that that's the sort of thing i would use now the mixing boost another two knob boost with a gain [Music] all right all right it wasn't that off i'm just playing sloppy it's my fault [Music] oh that's even dirtier [Music]
(11:52) i'm liking these boosts guys [Applause] [Music] there's almost like a fuzz thing going on with this one [Music] through most of the range of the gain knob though is clean a little bit of hair on there [Music] yeah they're still still a little bit hairy [Music]
(13:03) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i think this blue one is the one for me but uh let's stack them huh [Music] so [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] it's a noisy way to make a distortion or a fuzz whatever you want to call this well there's something very satisfying
(14:06) about that [Music] i'm just getting sloppy the compressor i should throw the compressor in too oh this is nuts [Music] so [Music] hey
(15:15) [Laughter] that is obnoxious all right i'm gonna throw in two of my favorites here out of this group so far that bright orange muff that dirty dirty boost this blue mixing boost i like that we'll use those to test the chorus and the tremolo try to get everything to fit and shot up here [Music] nice little bit of crispiness there from the boost uh let's try out the chorus a two knob chorus depth and rate how bad could it be right [Music]
(16:34) i don't know what to think of that [Music] it's doing more like a doubler thing than a chorus [Music] got kind of a hard shelf on that modulation rate too like you can really hear it like round [Music] round [Music] i don't know if i've ever heard a chorus
(17:45) sound quite like that [Music] has a really interesting and unique characteristic sounding more like a doubler then of course it is doing a chorusy thing but then the the shelf on that waveform is super [Music] abrupt [Music] so [Music] ah [Music] yeah i'm gonna call it it's not a chorus
(18:56) it's a doubler that's what you use that for for doubling up the sound of your playing i want to know how that would sound before that buzz [Music] there's a lot more noise in the signal with it before the fuzz i'll say that [Music] hey [Music] it does something interesting is it
(20:07) doing something good i'll let you guys decide all right on to the tremolo to knob tremolo here [Music] it flashes that's nice to show you the rate [Music] it it's not boosting the signal i i'd say it's sitting at unity fairly nicely i like the tremolo pedal to boost a little bit a little bit of like a preamp boost if there's not going to be a volume knob on there so this is going to fall just under your mix when you engage this it's nice and hard not too fast though [Music] yeah most of the usable range of the
(21:14) rate control is passed here i can barely see myself using a trim that's even that slow to me that's right about where tremolo starts [Music] hmm [Music] so
(22:40) [Music] yeah i'm gonna say no to the tremolo i'm gonna say yes to the mixing boost because i like how dirty that gets and i like the way it gets dirty [Music] that like loose crispy grit that has brief moments of like fizziness mixed in [Music] i think that's pretty cool the fuzz i think that's really fun it's it's a big muff it sounds like a big muff sounds huge [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
(23:51) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah i'm gonna have to do a big muff shoot out but in this moment i'm really liking this bright orange dolomo fuzz that's pretty great the super chorus uh i don't know i don't know guys what do you think is doing more of a doubling sound i can't see myself committing space on a board to it but i want to know what you think um the distortion was interesting i'm not sure i get it the compressor does the same thing every other affordable compressor a cupboard does it does that hard
(24:50) dynacomp kind of compressor the clear boost if i hadn't tried this one i would have been liking this one but this one just did a little bit more dirt the di i'm gonna have to put together a praise and worship afford a board and use this at church and this will be on the board because i use a di every time i play at church because i run straight into the front of house i'll find out then if it works i don't have any good way to actually test it right now but anyways as far as i'm concerned these two are my favorites out of this
(25:31) grouping um i would pass on the tremolo and probably the super course unless you heard something in this that you think works for something that you want to do a doubling sound that kind of glitchy like hard modulation that it's doing but i think these are our goodbyes in my opinion none of them are gonna go on the affordable this time i don't think they're gonna replace anything on here i don't need the boost on here i don't need a big muff on here um i typically don't run a lot of big muff sounds but i do think it is a good sounding big
(26:12) muff so anyways huge thanks to dolomo for sending these out to me click the links down below if you're gonna shop for these uh there's an ebay store that has them all and they're actually the ones that sourced it to me so i don't know if they have an official connection to dolomo but uh please support them for uh supporting this channel supporting this series the affordable series like subscribe dislike leave me a rudeness comment support some patreon buy a shirt if you're naked all that other stuff and stay grounded
(26:38) bye everybody you
