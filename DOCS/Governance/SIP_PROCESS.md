# SIP Process

## When to open a SIP
Open a SIP for:
- New feature tracks (routing engine, recall system, resample workflows)
- Governance/policy changes
- Changes that impact many presets/users

## Lifecycle
Draft → Review → Accepted/Rejected → Implemented → Closed

## Required sections
Problem, Proposal, Non-goals, Success metrics, Dependencies, Rollout/Migration, Risks

## Relationship to RFC/ADR
- SIP sets direction and scope.
- RFC designs the technical approach (if needed).
- ADR records decisions made during implementation.
