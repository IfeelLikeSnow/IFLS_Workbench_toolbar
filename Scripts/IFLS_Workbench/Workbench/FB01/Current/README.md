# FB-01 Current

This folder provides *stable entry points* to the current FB-01 toolset, without breaking older Pack_vX paths.

## Why
The repo contains multiple historical FB-01 packs (Pack_v2, v3, v5, v7, v8...).  
External references (toolbar buttons, actions, docs) might still point to older Pack paths.

`Current/` provides canonical launch scripts that forward to the *current* pack.

## Current pack
- Pack_v8 (as of V77)

## Entry points
- `IFLS_FB01_Toolkit_Current.lua` (recommended)
