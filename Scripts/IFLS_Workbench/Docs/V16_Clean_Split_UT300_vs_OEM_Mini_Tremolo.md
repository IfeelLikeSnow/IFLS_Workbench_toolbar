# V16 Clean Split: UT300 vs OEM Mini Tremolo

User confirmed ownership of **Behringer UT300 Ultra Tremolo** (photo provided), which has 3 knobs:
- RATE, DEPTH, WAVE (triangle ↔ square morph)

In v15, UT300 was accidentally overwritten by a 2-knob OEM mini tremolo profile.

## Fixes in V16
1. Restored UT300 controls to **RATE / DEPTH / WAVE** (manual + panel verified).
2. Created a new profile:
   - `oem_mini_tremolo_2knob_goldenbull` = "OEM Mini Tremolo (2 Knobs) – Golden Bull"
   - Controls: INTENSITY / RATE

## Metadata
Both profiles now include:
- `controls_verified_by_image=true`
- `meta.panel_verified=true` with timestamp
