# V35 Research Queue + Issues

Timestamp: 2026-02-03T04:37:03Z

## What was added
1. Generated one Markdown research issue per unknown pedal:
   - Folder: `Research_Issues/`
   - Each file mirrors the GitHub issue template but works offline.
2. Added a Research Queue script stub:
   - `Scripts/IFLS_Workbench/Tools/IFLS_Workbench_Research_Queue.lua`

## How to use now
- Pick a pedal from `Research_Issues/`
- Do deep web research (manuals, videos, listings)
- Update the profile JSON
- Bump tag to WV/VV/PV/MR
- Close the issue file (or delete it)

Next step (V36):
- Full ReaImGui Research Queue panel with filters + one-click open.
