# V22 Verification Badges + Tooltips

## Fix
- Removed a stray `require_panel` snippet that could break the Apply section (introduced by an earlier patch attempt).

## UX upgrade
- Added verification tags to role suggestions + current pick display:
  - [MR] Manual-rich
  - [PV] Panel-verified
  - [WV] Web-verified
  - [PM] Partial-manual
- Added tooltips explaining each tag (hover over item or legend).
