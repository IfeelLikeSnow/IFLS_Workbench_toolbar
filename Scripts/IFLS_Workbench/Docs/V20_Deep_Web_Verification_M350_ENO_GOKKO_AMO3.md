This pass deepened verification for previously 'B/C' devices:

- ENO T-Cube Reverb: web-verified controls + LED mode colors (Room/Spring/Well).
- GOKKO GK-22 Dripping Delay: web-verified control range (25–600ms) + clarification on 'optional modulation'.
- Aroma AMO-3 Mario Bit Crusher: web-verified filter switch positions (HP/Normal/LP) + knob functions; note about small button mentioned in listings.
